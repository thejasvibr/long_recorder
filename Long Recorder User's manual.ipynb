    "## The long recorder module : \n",
    "The long recorder module allows the user to record for a desired duration of time when triggered. This notebook will explain how to use it. This module presents an open-source solution to running long-duration recordings with flexible settings. Eg. some open source solutions (Audacity) allow recording from only stereo channel sub-configurations in a multichannel soundcard (if not compiled properly in Windows). \n",
    "\n",
    "This module was primarily designed to be used for long-duration or repetitive audio recordings that are triggered by a separate script or by a task scheduler. The output is a WAV file with the timestamp of recording initiation. \n",
    "\n",
    "Long recorder was developed to be used in experiments being run by Dr. Sue Anne Zollinger at the Coomunication and Social Behaviour Group, Max Planck Institute for Ornithology, Seewiesen. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Development and testing : \n",
    "The long recorder module was developed and tested on Anaconda installs of Python 2.7.12 with the following external libraries to support it:\n",
    "*  sounddevice version 0.3.5\n",
    "* soundfile version 0.8.1 \n",
    "* numpy 1.13.1 \n",
    "\n",
    "All testing took place on Windows 7  64 bit laptops. As long as sounddevice and soundfile are able to run, it should be possible to run this on Linux/Mac OS computers too. "

    "Pay attention to any mentions of 'USB' or 'ASIO' in the names, and look carefully at the number of channels on offer for each of the listed devices. It may be that the same 'electronic unit' (eg. one soundcard device) is treated as multiple digital devices by sounddevice. For instance the M-Audio M Track Eight soundcard above is being recognised in terms of all possible configurations it can be used in. \n",

    "#### Example 3 : Scheduling the recorder with the help of Windows task scheduler :\n",
    "If you cannot manually initiate the recordings because of odd time, experiment in progress or anything else, it is necessary to automate the scheduling. \n",
    "\n",
    "The easiest way to do this would be to write another python script that triggers long recorder as is necessary. However, this would imply the need for a python process running all the time, and if the same computer is being used for other purposes, it increases the risk that a user may accidentally close the window. To overcome such problems, you could call long recorder on a 'as needed' basis. With Windows Task Scheduler:  1) the module will be called and the recordings will take place without any obvious signs of it. Here is how to configure this. \n",
